# rackspace-user cookbook
The default recipe creates a `rack` user and updates the authorized_keys file.

The additional_users recipe creates users based on a data structure in node["rackspace"]["users"].

```ruby
For example,  
node["rackspace"]["users"]["kilroy"] = [
  "enabled" => true,  
  "sudo" => "passwordless",  
  "password" => "$6$passwordhashasdf/.asdf./asdf./awe/awletr.lj/sldj",  
  "note" => "Kilroy was here",  
  "home" => "/home/kilroy",  
  "shell" => "/bin/bash",  
  "authorized_keys" => [  
    "AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC3vjtkdo1eO9eM22+vTza2+fne0yW4WnCnX3zhvOZY4V3covLXWDQN/X04U7+DIMwYeKMr9JQrd4kwvzXA0o44851Vk4AG7rP/E0982HcZ7ScK+K8W2h73uwV75VgTWzqiyy/FxLVr0Ut41UGb6wTUfTOHqvVgiDuB7Hxum3++MRUlDm7vEjRuMyGQQ2ma8fVFUgwL+5R00+reOJ2/+C2UJcwrKINwu/lBQkD6WBLxfu+Aw4sHI+LRzjO8pSmCletVwIA4yWONWPvKO34cxccmhxcjHTrwgVoUeBLOkP9nUT7MJA5W9fcA+7jt18d+SsGaj4b4u5skShaMAicgfnTF"
  ]
]  
```
  
# Requirements
No other cookbooks are required for the base role, minitest-handler is recommended to execute the tests in ./files/default/tests/minitest/

# Usage
By default this will make a passwordless ssh user named rack using the ssh keys from a remote file. All of this can be modified through attributes. 

The additional_users recipe allows you to create regular users based off of a data hash.

# Attributes

    node["rackspace-user"]["user"] user to create  
    node["rackspace-user"]["remote_file"] remote file that contains ssh keys  
    node["rackspace-user"]["shell"] users shell  
    node["rackspace-user"]["home_folder"] users home folder  


    node["rackspace"]["users"] hash of users, keys are usernames.
    enabled: Boolean true/false, determines if the user is actually created.  
    manage_home: Boolean true/false, determines if the home directory is created.  
    sudo: Boolean true/false, determines if they get sudo access.
    password: This takes a password hash for the users login.
    note: This fills the user comment field.
    home: Sets the users home directory and creates it.
    shell: Sets the users shell.
    authorized_keys: This is an array of available ssh public keys for this user.
